Business Understanding - Bank Marketing:

A Portuguese bank had conducted a telemarketing campaign for a term deposit product somewhere around late 2010. A term deposit is very similar to a fixed deposit, where you deposit money for a fixed period of time.  

Through the campaign, the bank had collected data about the prospects' demographics, other financial products they have purchased in the past (loans, deposits, etc.), the number of times they were called, etc. They also recorded the response data, i.e., whether the person had subscribed to the term deposit product, which is the target variable. 

The bank's marketing team wants to launch yet another telemarketing campaign for the same product. You, an analyst at the bank, want to answer the following questions using the past data:

1. Which prospects are more likely to buy the product (i.e., to respond )?
2. Which attributes determine the propensity to buy a term deposit?  
3. Once you predict the likelihood of response, how many prospects should you target for telemarketing?
4. By how much can you reduce the marketing cost using the model, and how many prospects will you acquire?
 
Let's see how you can answer these questions using what are called 'response models' in marketing analytics.
